Musify is a simple and fast music player, built from the ground up, using web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, all wrapped on an electron environment.
This is my first project as a computer science student. I've tried my best to write a code that follows common coding conventions, but keep in mind that you may find spaghetti code, poorly documented code or common beginner errors. If so, feel free to help and contribute to improve this app.
